These are programs from the book "Basic Computer Games Microcomputer
Edition" by David H. Ahl, 1978.

They have been adapted to run on the 68000 version of Enhanced Basic.

Most games have instructions in the .txt file corresponding to the
.bas file for the game.

Some games were omitted as they were not easy to port.
