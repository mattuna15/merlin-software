This is the 68000 monitor for the Teesside TS2 single board computer
from the book "Microprocessor Systems Design - 68000 Hardware,
Software, and Interfacing", third edition, by Alan Clements.

This is based on the version on the included CD-ROM with changes to
assemble under the GNU assembler.

The original versions can be found on the "original" folder.

Minimon is a version designed to run under the simulator. Monitor is
the version that runs on the the TS2 hardware.

Some hacks were needed in order to get the assembled output to exactly
match the original. If you make any changes to the code it may break
due to some hardcoded symbol values.
