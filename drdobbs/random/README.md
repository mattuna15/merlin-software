This is the source for "A Pseudo Random-Number Generator" by Michael
P. McLaughlin from Dr. Dobb's Toolbook of 68000 Programming.

It has been modified slightly to compile with the VASM assembler.

Original description:

The pseudo random-number generator routine presented below uses an
algorithm commonly known as "GGUBS." This is a good algorithm with a
very long period.
