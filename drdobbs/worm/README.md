This is the source for "The Work Memory Test" by Jan Steinman from Dr.
Dobb's Toolbook of 68000 Programming.

It has been modified slightly to compile with the VASM assembler.

Original description:

The Worm is a memory test that has the unusual
characteristic of being able to overlay itself
while it's running. It makes special use of
the 68000's instruction prefetch register.
