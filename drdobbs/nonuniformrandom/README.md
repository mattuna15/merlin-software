This is the source for "Generating Nonuniform Distributions of Random
Numbers" by Chris Crawford from Dr. Dobb's Toolbook of 68000
Programming.

It has been modified slightly to compile with the VASM assembler.

Original description:

Sometimes it's important to generate random numbers
whose distribution is nonuniform. This chapter shows how
to approximate the well-known (but hard to simulate)
Gaussian distribution of numbers (the "bell curve").
