These directories contain the program examples from the book "68000
Assembly Language Programming", 2nd edition, by Lance A. Leventhal,
Doug Hawkins, Gerry Kane and William D. Cramer.

It only includes the examples that are complete programs. You will
need to refer to the book for details of what each program does. A few
minor changes and corrections have been made.

Makefiles are provided to build with the code the VASM assembler (see
http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/).
