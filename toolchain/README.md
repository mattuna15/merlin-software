# Toolchain
This folder contains the recipes for installing the complete toolchain from compiling, assembling, disassembling and binary 
manipulation to ROM flashing. The Makefile offers the following installation options:

## Generic install configuration options
All install recipes allow overriding the binary install directory, but often this requires root rights. By default,
programs are installed to ~/.local/ unless stated otherwise. This assumes that ~/.local/bin is in your PATH variable.
Please make sure that this is the case, or none of the installed toolchain programs will function. 

Using ~/.local makes the installation now portable: for example if your home folder is on a different partition. 
The install path can be configured to point somewhere else by prepending all make instructions below with 
`INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/your/install/dir`, unless stated otherwise.

Also, the make recipes use the default TMP dir to temporarily store retrieved source code files. This can also be overridden by
prepending install commands with `TMP=/path/to/your/tmp/dir`

## SREC
SREC is an easy to use tool useful for converting between assembled binaries and Motorola S-record files.

### Installation
From this directory, run:
```shell
make srec-install
```

By default, the installation script installs to your ~/.local/ dir so that the entire installation can be run without
root rights. You can install to a different dir by prepending the make command with INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/your/install/dir.

### Uninstall
```shell
make srec-uninstall
```

Note that you have to specify the same install dir if you specified a custom INSTALL_DIR during installation.

## SRecord
SRecord is (somewhat confusingly) a very elaborate set of tools useful for working with ROM files.

### Installation
S-record need to install libboost and libtool for your OS. On Debian-like systems this amounts to 
```shell script
sudo apt-get install -y libboost-dev libtool-bin ghostscript
```
but on other distributions you will require, yum, dnf or whatever package manager is available on your system. Note that
libtool-bin installs the required `libtool` executable, the one that the `configure` script for SRecord looks for. 
Oddly enough, this is executable is not in the `libtool` package, but in `libtool-bin`, at least not in recent Debian or
Debian-derivative distributions. The ghostscript package is required for building the documentation.

From this directory, run:
```shell
make srecord-install
```

By default, the installation script installs to your ~/.local/ dir so that the entire installation can be run without
root rights. You can install to a different dir by prepending the make command with INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/your/install/dir.

### Uninstall
```shell
make srecord-uninstall
```

### Usage
Once installed, you can call: 
- `srec2bin` to convert an S-record file to a binary file. See `srec2bin --help` for more detailed instructions.
- `bin2srec` to convert a binary file to an S-record. See `bin2srec --help` for more detailed instructions.
- `binsplit` to split a binary into even and odd bit files, for example to split a combined binary file into an odd and 
an even ROM file to flash to even and odd ROM chips.

## GCC cross-compiler
This tool is incredibly useful to write your own programs for the Motorola 68000 in more familiar languages (more 
familiar than Assembly, that is) such as C, C++, Objective-C or even Fortran if you like. There's an 
[overview of supported languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection#Languages) from which you can 
choose your favorite. Note that most of these are untested for m68k targets though, and bear in mind that any 
[garbage-collected language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) will come with a 
runtime that is almost guaranteed to exceed the memory limitations of the TS2 board. Your safest bet is on languages
that aren't garbage-collected, such as C and C++, and even then the ROM limitations of the TS2 are comparable with an
[Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno&gt;#techspecs). 

### Installation
From this directory, run:
```shell
make gcc-install
```

By default only C support (a 'front end' in GCC terms) is enabled in this install recipe, but you can override this 
setting by using the GCC_LANGUAGES variable:
```shell
GCC_LANGUAGES=c,c++ make gcc-install
```

By default, the installation script installs to your ~/.local/bin dir so that the entire installation can be run without
root rights. You can install to a different bin dir by prepending the make command with INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/your/bin/dir.

### Uninstall
```shell
make gcc-uninstall
```

Note that you have to specify the same install dir if you specified a custom INSTALL_DIR during installation.

### Usage
Once installed, you can use `m68k-elf-gcc` to compile your own programs to run on m68k hardware! Compilation is done by
specifying the target processor. See the [Makefile](../c_example/Makefile) in the c_example dir on how to use it.

## Newlib
[Newlib](https://sourceware.org/newlib/) is a library that provides a C standard library where there is no operating 
system present that can provide such a library. Normally, you would compile programs on an OS like Linux that provides
libc out of the box. However, the TS2 Tutor environment is nowhere near fully-fledged operating system. Newlib therefore
provides vital functionality in minimal environments, such as the TS2.

### Installation
```shell
make newlib-install
```
 
Note that `make newlib-install` requires a pre-installed gcc cross compiler (see [instructions](#gcc-cross-compiler)).
By default, the installation script installs to your ~/.local/ dir so that the entire installation can be run without
root rights. You can install to a different bin dir by prepending the make command with INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/your/install/dir.

### Uninstall
```shell
make newlib-uninstall
```

Note that you have to specify the same install dir if you specified a custom INSTALL_DIR during installation.

### Usage
Once installed, you can use libc-like standard library functions in your C programs:
 - see [their standard library documentation](https://sourceware.org/newlib/libc.html) 
 - see [their math library documentation](https://sourceware.org/newlib/libm.html)

It's difficult to overstate the usefulness of these libraries. Now, you can do sines, cosines, powers, roots, quicksorts,
 random numbers and all the other goodness that comes with libc. For more usage instructions, see the 
 [newlib README](newlib/README.md)

## Assembler
Besides the GCC m68k-elf assembler `m68k-elf-as` there is also a stand-alone 68k assembler available in VASM. The 
benefit of having this assembler is that it is extremely compact to download, build and install.

### Installation
```shell
make vasm-install
```

### Uninstall
```shell
make vasm-uninstall
```
### Usage
See [instructions](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/index.php?view=tutorial)

## Disassembler
The toolchain includes a disassembler written in Python.

### Installation
```shell
make disasm-install
```

### Uninstall
```shell
make disasm-uninstall
```

### Usage
See [instructions](disasm/README.md)
